# EMR Serverless CloudWatch Dashboard

You can visualize EMR Serverless application and job metrics in a CloudWatch Dashboard. The CloudFormation template provided in this repo can be used to deploy the sample CloudWatch Dashboard for Spark applications on EMR Serverless.

## Overview

The CloudWatch Dashboard provides an overview of pre-initialized capacity vs. OnDemand as well as drill-down metrics for CPU, memory, and disk usage for Spark Drivers and Executors. [Pre-initialized capacity is an optional feature of EMR Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-Serverless-UserGuide/application-capacity.html) that keeps driver and workers pre-initialized and ready to respond in seconds and this dashboard can help understand if pre-initialized capacity is being used effectively.

In addition, you can see job-level metrics for the state of your jobs on a per-application basis.

Follow along below to see how to get started or see a full demo in the [walkthrough](#example-walkthrough) section.

## Getting started

**From the CloudFormation Console:**

1. Open the AWS CloudFormation console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation.
2. Create a new stack by choosing: `Create Stack`
3. Choose the option `Upload a template file` and upload the `emr_serverless_cloudwatch_dashboard.yaml` template
4. In the next page, add a Stack name for the stack.
5. In the Parameters section, put in the `Application ID` of the EMR Serverless application you want to monitor
6. Choose `Create Stack` in the final page.

**From the CLI:**

Alternatively, you can also deploy this dashboard using the CLI:

```
aws cloudformation create-stack --region <region> \
    --stack-name emr-serverless-dashboard \
    --template-body <file:///path/emr_serverless_cloudwatch_dashboard.yaml> \
    --parameters ParameterKey=ApplicationID,ParameterValue=<Application Id>
```

Once the stack is created, you'll have a new CloudWatch Dashboard with the name `emr-serverless-dashboard-<APPLICATION_ID>` under Dashboards in the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.

## Example Walkthrough

Let's take a quick look and see how we can use the dashboard to optimize our EMR Serverless applications.

In this example, we'll start an application with a limited set of pre-initialized capacity and run jobs that both fit and exceed that capacity and see what happens.

> [!NOTE]
> EMR Serverless sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch every 1 minute, so you may see different behavior depending on how quickly you run the commands.

### Pre-requisites

To walk through this demo, you'll need the following:

- Access to EMR Serverless and the ability to create new CloudFormation Stacks
- A job runtime role (for instructions see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-Serverless-UserGuide/getting-started.html#gs-prerequisites)

### Walkthrough

1. Create and start an EMR Serverless application with an initial capacity of 1 driver and 4 executors. 

```bash
aws emr-serverless create-application \
    --name cloudwatch-dashboard-demo \
    --type SPARK \
    --release-label emr-6.7.0 \
    --initial-capacity '{
        "DRIVER": {
            "workerCount": 1,
            "workerConfiguration": {
                "cpu": "2vCPU",
                "memory": "4GB"
            }
        },
        "EXECUTOR": {
            "workerCount": 4,
            "workerConfiguration": {
                "cpu": "4vCPU",
                "memory": "8GB"
            }
        }
    }'
```

You'll get back information about the created application - set your `APPLICATION_ID` environment variable appropriately.

```json
{
    "applicationId": "00fabcdef12525",
    "name": "cloudwatch-dashboard-demo",
    "arn": "arn:aws:emr-serverless:us-east-1:123456789012:/applications/00fabcdef12525"
}
```

```bash
APPLICATION_ID=00fabcdef12525
aws emr-serverless start-application --application-id $APPLICATION_ID
```

Wait for the application to start and continue with the next step.

```bash
aws emr-serverless get-application --application-id $APPLICATION_ID
```

```json
{
    "application": {
        "applicationId": "00fabcdef12525",
        "name": "cloudwatch-dashboard-demo",
        "arn": "arn:aws:emr-serverless:us-east-1:123456789012:/applications/00fabcdef12525",
        "releaseLabel": "emr-6.7.0",
        "type": "Spark",
        "state": "STARTED",
        ...
    }
}
```

2. Create a CloudWatch Dashboard

Using the `APPLICATION_ID` variable above, create the corresponding dashboard.

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack \
    --stack-name emr-serverless-dashboard \
    --template-body file://emr_serverless_cloudwatch_dashboard.yaml \
    --parameters ParameterKey=ApplicationID,ParameterValue=$APPLICATION_ID
```

Go ahead and open your new dashboard:

```bash
open https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#dashboards:name=emr-serverless-dashboard-$APPLICATION_ID
```

You should notice your application is currently showing 0% "Pre-Initialized Capacity Worker Utilization" and you have 5 Pre-Initialized workers in the "Available Workers" section. That's the combined value of your drivers and executors.

3. Run a simple job

Let's go ahead and run a job that will consume a limited amount of resources. We'll use the [Pi example](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/examples/src/main/python/pi.py) built in to Spark.

Because we configured our pre-initialized capacity a little bit lower than the [Spark defaults](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-Serverless-UserGuide/jobs-spark.html#spark-defaults), we need to explicitly specify driver and executor settings when we submit the job.

```bash
# Set your job runtime role as a variable
JOB_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/EMRServerlessS3RuntimeRole

aws emr-serverless start-job-run \
    --name pi-default \
    --application-id $APPLICATION_ID \
    --execution-role-arn $JOB_ROLE_ARN \
    --job-driver '{
        "sparkSubmit": {
            "entryPoint": "local:///usr/lib/spark/examples/src/main/python/pi.py",
            "sparkSubmitParameters": "--conf spark.driver.cores=2 --conf spark.driver.memory=3g --conf spark.executor.memory=7g"
        }
    }'
```

If we look at the "Running Drivers" and "Running Executors" charts, we'll see that 1 Pre-Initialized Driver and 3 Pre-Initilized Executors are being used, while there are 0 OnDemand workers. 

![](images/demo/pi-default.png)

Let's see what happens when we use more executors than the pre-initialized capacity.

4. Run a job with more executors

We'll simply tell EMR Serverless to use more executor instances (the default is 3) and bump up the number of tasks in the `pi.py` job so the executors actually get used.

```bash
aws emr-serverless start-job-run \
    --name pi-more-executors \
    --application-id $APPLICATION_ID \
    --execution-role-arn $JOB_ROLE_ARN \
    --job-driver '{
        "sparkSubmit": {
            "entryPoint": "local:///usr/lib/spark/examples/src/main/python/pi.py",
            "entryPointArguments": ["2000"],
            "sparkSubmitParameters": "--conf spark.driver.cores=2 --conf spark.driver.memory=3g --conf spark.executor.memory=7g --conf spark.executor.instances=10"
        }
    }'
```

Now if we look at the "Running Executors" chart, we'll see that we're using additional OnDemand capacity because we have more executors than the "4" configured for pre-initialized capacity.

![](images/demo/pi-more-executors.png)

Note that the job started immediately because we had enough capacity for the driver and it added more executors after the job started.

5. Run a job with more drivers

If we submit two jobs at once, we'll see that the first job can make use of pre-initialized capacity while the second job will request OnDemand capacity.

```bash
aws emr-serverless start-job-run \
    --name pi-more-drivers-1 \
    --application-id $APPLICATION_ID \
    --execution-role-arn $JOB_ROLE_ARN \
    --job-driver '{
        "sparkSubmit": {
            "entryPoint": "local:///usr/lib/spark/examples/src/main/python/pi.py",
            "entryPointArguments": ["10000"],
            "sparkSubmitParameters": "--conf spark.driver.cores=2 --conf spark.driver.memory=3g --conf spark.executor.memory=7g"
        }
    }'

aws emr-serverless start-job-run \
    --name pi-more-drivers-2 \
    --application-id $APPLICATION_ID \
    --execution-role-arn $JOB_ROLE_ARN \
    --job-driver '{
        "sparkSubmit": {
            "entryPoint": "local:///usr/lib/spark/examples/src/main/python/pi.py",
            "entryPointArguments": ["10000"],
            "sparkSubmitParameters": "--conf spark.driver.cores=2 --conf spark.driver.memory=3g --conf spark.executor.memory=7g"
        }
    }'
```

In the EMR Studio console, we see the first job starts running immediately and the second is "Scheduled" pending an OnDemand Driver.

![](images/demo/pi-drivers.png)

In the "Running Drivers" chart, we'll see 1 Pre-Initialized driver and 1 OnDemand driver as EMR Serverless responds to the request for more resources. 

![](images/demo/pi-drivers-chart.png)

Feel free to try other configurations and see how the dashboard responds. When you're done, make sure to delete your EMR Serverless application if you no longer need it.

```bash
aws emr-serverless stop-application --application-id $APPLICATION_ID
aws emr-serverless delete-application --application-id $APPLICATION_ID
```
